# Budget_App
FreeCodeCamp Python Project

Budget App is a simple python program that helps you manage your transactions. With the app you can record the amount deposited and withdrawn. You can also transfer to other accounts and check your balance and available funds. In addition, the app provides a graphical representation of your expenditures. 

You can check out the program test on replit (budget.py): https://replit.com/@Ahmod/boilerplate-budget-app-5#budget.py
